# slider-puzzle

Uses A* algorithm to find a solution to a n x n slider puzzle.
The heuristic used is the manhattan distance.
To find if the puzzle is actually solvable or not the program runs A* parallely on the given puzzle, and a "twin" puzzle generated by the initial puzzle with one swaping of entries. Only puzzles with even number of inversions are solvable, so exactly one of the initial and it's twin will be solvable.
